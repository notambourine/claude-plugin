# Pull request

Use the target repo's committed template, searching `.github/`, the repo root, and `docs/`.
Without one, use this skill's
[.github/pull_request_template.md](.github/pull_request_template.md). Preserve the chosen
template's headings and markers.

Plain register: concrete nouns, no inflated adjectives, no `not just X but Y` framing, no
closing flourish.

Hard caps, whichever template you use: 80 characters per bullet, 200 per paragraph. Over the
cap, cut a claim; never split it across lines or move it into a bullet. Count before
submitting and again after any revision.

Derive problem, outcome, scope, decisions from issue, source, diff, and commits. Never rely
on branch or subjects alone. Open on outcome. Explain behavior and decisions, not files.
Keep proportional. Specific title. Draft unless ready requested.

Visible changes: add useful named before/after captures; recording for motion or flows.
Upload as GitHub user attachments. Read
[references/github-attachments.md](references/github-attachments.md).

Submit with `gh pr create` or `gh pr edit`, preserving formatting.
