# End-of-day update

Draft only. Never post.

Use today's local commits and authenticated GitHub events: authored, reviewed, commented,
merged. Verify event timestamps; deduplicate PRs; collapse commits into outcomes. For
teammate PRs, name the user's action. For authored PRs, name current state. Ask only for
unrecoverable work, tomorrow, blockers.

Return only:

```text
🌇 *EOD Update DD-MM-YYYY*

✅ *Done*
• [item]

🔨 *Doing*
• [item]

🚩 *Blockers*
• [item or None]

📝 *Notes*
[optional]
```

Slack strips markdown on paste, so emit Slack mrkdwn: bold is `*one asterisk*`, bullets are a
literal `•`, and the block is bare text rather than a fenced code block.

Short items. PR numbers, no URLs. Always Blockers. Omit empty Notes. Missing repo context:
use answers only.
