# Deploy updates

Draft only. Never deploy or post. Output obeys
[../../recap-format.md](../../recap-format.md).

Mode:

- Pre-deploy default: remote default branch to user branch, first of `dev`, `staging`,
  `develop`, `release`, else `HEAD`.
- Retrospective: previous to current observed remote-default reflog tip.

Fetch `origin`; stop on failure. Resolve endpoints, short SHAs, dates, count, then write the
update. Never ask the user to confirm the range; a range the user named in the invocation is
already the answer.

Zero: nothing pending/shipped. Empty retrospective reflog: request one. No origin: request
deployment repo. An explicit range accepts reflog entry, SHA, tag, date.

Inspect non-merge commits. Resolve PR by referenced number or SHA; read PR body, then linked
issues and diff stat as needed. Exclude work ancestral to start. Translate unsupported
commits cautiously. Collapse related work and routine dependency/CI noise.

Return only:

```text
🚀 **Deploys: <window> (M/D/YY)**

✨ **Features**

* **Label:** Outcome in one short sentence.

🛠️ **Fixes**

* **Label:** Outcome in one short sentence.
```

Window names the range in the reader's terms: `Last N Days` retrospective, `Pending`
pre-deploy.

Sections in this order, only those needed: ✨ Features, 🛠️ Fixes, ⚡ Performance,
📈 SEO & Marketing, 🗂️ Admin & Internal, ⚙️ Behind the Scenes.
