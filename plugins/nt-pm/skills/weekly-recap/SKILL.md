# Weekly recap

Draft only. Whole team. Output obeys [../../recap-format.md](../../recap-format.md). Use
named window; otherwise ask 1-4 weeks. Compute inclusive dates with available BSD/GNU
`date` syntax.

Collect merged PRs since start, all open PRs, recent non-merge commits, recently touched
branches. Merged PRs define Shipped. Open merge-ready core PRs define In Review. Active
unmerged branches define In Progress. Represent each merged contributor's work, then remove
names. Skip empty PRs.

Return only:

Exactly these four emoji, in this order.
